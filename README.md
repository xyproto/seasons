# seasons

Change desktop wallpaper throughout the day, for any windowmanager.

Will also set the wallpaper if an image filename is given as the first argument.

# Work in progress

Currently changes the wallpaper to a random image from `/usr/share/pixmaps` if no argument is given!

The plan is to first support a large collection of windowmanagers and ways of setting the wallpaper.
